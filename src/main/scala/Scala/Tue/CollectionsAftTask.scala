  //Research:
  /** Research task 1:
   * Understanding Set vs Seq is important for testers because the choice affects how tests behave. For example, if a test is checking a list of results where order matters, Seq is the right choice. But if the goal is just to verify uniqueness or membership, a Set is safer and clearer. Using the wrong type can lead to false negatives in tests (e.g., failing because order changed but data is correct). It also helps when setting up test data â€” avoiding duplicates can prevent subtle bugs. Knowing this lets testers write better, more reliable tests and understand developer intentions more clearly.

  //2a/b.i. Map.get - returns an option, you either get it (Some) or you don't (None). This makes it safe to use when a key might not exist.
  println(failedLogins.get("andy")) //returns the value of the inputted key wrapped in a `Some`
  println(failedLogins.get("sarah")) //not in the list so returns a None
  //2a/b.ii. Map(key) - returns the value directly for the inputted key. Will throw an exception if it isn't there (not as safe).
  println(failedLogins("andy")) //returns the value of the inputted key
  //  println(failedLogins("sarah")) //throws an exception and cannot continue code execution
  //2a/b.iii. Map.getOrElse(key, default) - this means if the key isn't there it will return the default value that is given.
  println(failedLogins.getOrElse("andy", 0))
  println(failedLogins.getOrElse("sarah", 0))

  //2c. In testing, when might it be dangerous to use Map(key) directly?
  /** Using Map(key) is dangerous to use in test as a missing key will cause your code to throw a NoSuchElementException, which could:
   * 1. Crash your test suite
   * 2. Mask other issues by stopping execution
   * 3. Create flaky tests that only fail in some environments
   * Always best to use getOrElse
